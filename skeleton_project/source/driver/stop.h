 * \n 2. Turn on the stop light
 * \n 3. Delete the Elevator queue 
 * \n Then it returns 1 if the button was pushed, or 0 if not.

 * @param[out] elevator_queue The array that represents the queue system of the elevator.
 * @param[out] stop_array_up The array that indicates if the elevator floor panel up buttons are pushed. This will be reset.
 * @param[out] stop_array_down The array that indicates if the elevator floor panel down buttons are pushed. This will be reset.
 * @param[out] elevator_panel_lights_array The array that indicates if the elevator panel lights are on. This will be reset
 * @param[out] direction The variable that represents the direction of the elevator.
 * @return int of value "1" or "TRUE" if the stop button is pushed, "0" or "FALSE" if it is not pushed.
