/**
 * @brief Updates the floor state to the real time exact position of the elevator.
 * This function makes a semi-state for when the elevator is between two floors. 
 * \n It does this by:
 * \n 1. It checks if the elevator is in an undefined state or not.
 * \n 2. If the floor state is undefined, it checks the motor direction. Based on this it subtracts or adds "0.5" to the floor state value to indicate that the position of the elevator is between two floors. 
 * 
 * @param[in,out] current_floor A pointer to the value of the current floor state.
 * @param[in] floor_sensor A variable to the value of the floor state given the measurement of the floor sensor. 
 * @param[in] direction A pointer to the motor direction. 
 * @param[out] previous_floor A variable that gives the previous floor state value.
