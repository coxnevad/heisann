 * @brief This is the function that is supposed to delete orders of the elevator queue, light array or the stop arrays when the elevator stops at a floor.

 * 
 * @param[in] floor The variable that shows the current floor of the elevator.
 * @param[out] elevator_queue The array that represents the queue system of the elevator.
 * @param[out] stop_array_up The array that indicates if the elevator floor panel up buttons are pushed. 
 * @param[out] stop_array_down The array that indicates if the elevator floor panel down buttons are pushed. 
 * @param[out] elevator_panel_lights_array The array that indicates if the elevator panel lights are on.
